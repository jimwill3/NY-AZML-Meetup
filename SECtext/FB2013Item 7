Item 7.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations You should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to our historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors." For a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our user metrics, see the section entitled "Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data." Overview Our mission is to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected. We build products that support our mission by creating value for users, marketers, and developers: Users. We enable people who use Facebook to stay connected with their friends and family, to discover and learn what is going on in the world around them, and to share and express what matters to them to the people they care about. Marketers. We enable marketers to engage with more than 1.2 billion monthly active users (MAUs) on Facebook or subsets of our users based on information they have chosen to share with us such as their age, location, gender, or interests. We offer marketers benefits such as targeted reach, engagement, Facebook ads, Facebook ad system and ad measurement. Developers. We enable developers to use Facebook's developer services to build, grow and monetize their mobile and web applications that integrate with Facebook more rapidly and successfully. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising and from fees associated with our Payments infrastructure that enables users to purchase virtual and digital goods from developers with applications on the Facebook website. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded revenue of $7.87 billion, income from operations of $2.8 billion and net income of $1.5 billion. 36 Trends in Our User Metrics The numbers for our key metrics, our daily active users (DAUs), mobile DAUs, MAUs, mobile MAUs and average revenue per user (ARPU), and certain other metric such as mobile-only DAUs and mobile-only MAUs, do not include Instagram users unless they would otherwise qualify as such users, respectively, based on their other activities on Facebook. In addition, other user engagement metrics do not include Instagram unless otherwise specifically stated. Trends in the number of our users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the volume of Payments transactions, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures. •Daily Active Users (DAUs). We define a daily active user as a registered Facebook user who logged in and visited Facebook through our website or a mobile device, used our Messenger app, or took an action to share content or activity with his or her Facebook friends or connections via a third-party website or application that is integrated with Facebook, on a given day. We view DAUs, and DAUs as a percentage of MAUs, as measures of user engagement. Note: For purposes of reporting DAUs, MAUs, and ARPU by geographic region, Europe includes all users in Russia and Turkey, Asia includes all users in Australia and New Zealand, and Rest of World includes all users in Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. 37 Worldwide DAUs increased 22% to 757 million on average during December 2013 from 618 million during December 2012. We experienced growth in DAUs across major markets including Brazil, India and the United States. Overall growth in DAUs was driven largely by increased mobile usage of Facebook. The number of DAUs using personal computers decreased modestly in December 2013 compared to the same period in 2012. •Mobile DAUs. We define a mobile DAU as a user who accessed Facebook via a mobile application or via versions of our website such as m.facebook.com, whether on a mobile phone or tablet, on a given day. Worldwide mobile DAUs increased 49% to 556 million on average during December 2013 from 374 million during December 2012. In all regions, an increasing number of our DAUs are accessing Facebook through mobile devices, with users in Brazil, United States and India representing key sources of mobile growth on average during December 2013 as compared to the same period during 2012. There were 395 million mobile DAUs who accessed Facebook solely through mobile applications or our mobile website on average during the month ended December 31, 2013, increasing 65% from 240 million during the same period in 2012. The remaining 161 million mobile DAUs accessed Facebook from both personal computers and mobile devices during December 2013. We anticipate that the rate of growth in mobile usage will continue to be the primary driver of our user growth for the foreseeable future and that usage through personal computers may be flat or decline worldwide, including in key markets such as the United States and other developed markets in Europe and Asia. 38 •Monthly Active Users (MAUs). We define a monthly active user as a registered Facebook user who logged in and visited Facebook through our website or a mobile device, used our Messenger app, or took an action to share content or activity with his or her Facebook friends or connections via a third-party website or application that is integrated with Facebook, in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. MAUs are a measure of the size of our global active user community. As of December 31, 2013, we had 1.23 billion MAUs, an increase of 16% from December 31, 2012. Users in India, Brazil and Mexico represented key sources of growth in 2013 relative to the prior year. •Mobile MAUs. We define a mobile MAU as a user who accessed Facebook via a mobile application or via versions of our website such as m.facebook.com, whether on a mobile phone or tablet, during the period of measurement. 39 Worldwide mobile MAUs increased 39% to 945 million as of December 31, 2013 from 680 million as of December 31, 2012. In all regions, an increasing number of our MAUs are accessing Facebook through mobile devices, with users in India, Brazil, and the United States representing key sources of mobile growth over the fourth quarter of 2013 as compared to the same period in 2012. There were 296 million mobile MAUs who accessed Facebook solely through mobile applications or our mobile website during the month ended December 31, 2013, increasing 89% from 157 million during the same period in 2012. The remaining 649 million mobile MAUs accessed Facebook from both personal computers and mobile devices during December 2013. We anticipate that the rate of growth in mobile usage will continue to be the primary driver of our user growth for the foreseeable future and that usage through personal computers will decline worldwide, including in key markets such as the United States and other developed markets in Europe and Asia. 40 Trends in Our Monetization by User Geography We calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered or virtual and digital goods are purchased. We define ARPU as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of MAUs in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter. Annual ARPU is the sum of respective quarterly ARPU amounts in that year. The geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates. Our revenue and ARPU in regions such as United States & Canada and Europe are relatively higher due to the size and maturity of those advertising markets as well as our greater sales presence and the number of payment methods that we make available to marketers and users. For example, ARPU for an average user in 2013 in United States & Canada is more than five times higher than for an average user in Asia. Note: Our revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. This allocation differs from our revenue by geography disclosure in our consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the location of the marketer or developer. 41 For 2013, worldwide ARPU was $6.81, an increase of 28% from 2012. Over this period, ARPU increased by approximately 43% in Rest of World, 38% in the United States & Canada, 36% in Europe and 34% in Asia. User growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively lower ARPU, such as Asia and Rest of World. We expect that user growth in the future will continue to be higher in those regions where ARPU is relatively lower, such as Asia and Rest of World, such that worldwide ARPU may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to ARPU in any geographic region, or potentially decrease even if ARPU increases in each geographic region. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition for payments and other fees, income taxes, share-based compensation, loss contingencies, and business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 of our accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Revenue Recognition for Payments and Other Fees We enable Payments from our users to developers with applications on the Facebook website. Our users can make payments on Facebook by using debit and credit cards, PayPal, mobile phone payments, gift cards or other methods. We receive a fee from developers when a user engages in a payment transaction for the purchase of a virtual or digital good on the Facebook website. The price of the virtual or digital good is a price that is solely determined by the developer. We remit to the developer an amount that is based on the total amount of transaction less the processing fee that we charge the developer for the service performed. Our revenue is the net amount of the transaction representing our processing fee for the transaction. We record revenue on a net basis as we do not consider ourselves to be the principal in the sale of the virtual or digital good to the user. Under GAAP guidance related to reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent, the indicators used to determine whether an entity is a principal or an agent to a transaction are subject to judgment. We consider ourselves the agent to these transactions when we apply the indicators to our facts. Should material subsequent changes in the substance or nature of the transactions with developers result in us being considered the principal in such sales, we would reflect the virtual and digital goods sale as revenue and the amounts paid to the developers as an associated cost. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws. We record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Under this method, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. We make adjustments to these reserves when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that we believe are appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties. Share-based Compensation Prior to January 1, 2011 we granted RSUs (Pre-2011 RSUs) to our employees and members of our board of directors that vested upon the satisfaction of both a service-based condition, generally over four years, and a liquidity condition. The liquidity condition was 42 satisfied in connection with our IPO in May 2012. Therefore, we did not recognize any expense relating to the granting of the Pre-2011 RSUs until the completion of our IPO. For the Pre-2011 RSUs, we recognize share-based compensation expense using the accelerated attribution method, net of estimated forfeitures, in which compensation cost for each vesting tranche in an award is recognized ratably from the service inception date to the vesting date for that tranche. RSUs granted on or after January 1, 2011 (Post-2011 RSUs) are not subject to a liquidity condition in order to vest, and compensation expense related to these grants is based on the grant date fair value of the RSUs and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the applicable service period. The majority of Post-2011 RSUs are earned over a service period of four to five years. For Post-2011 RSUs, which are only subject to a service condition, we recognize share-based compensation expense on a ratable basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. We account for share-based employee compensation plans under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions in accordance with applicable accounting standards, which require all share-based payments to employees, including grants of stock options and RSUs, to be measured based on the grant-date fair value of the awards. Share-based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures in our consolidated statements of income and as such is recorded for only those share-based awards that we expect to vest. We estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical forfeitures of equity awards and adjust the rate to reflect changes in facts and circumstances, if any. We will revise our estimated forfeiture rate if actual forfeitures differ from our initial estimates. We have historically issued unvested restricted shares to employee stockholders of certain acquired companies. As these awards are generally subject to continued post-acquisition employment, we have accounted for them as post-acquisition share-based compensation expense. We recognize compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value of the common stock on a straight-line basis over the employee's required service period. Loss Contingencies We are involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. We review these provisions at least quarterly and adjust these provisions accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. We believe that the amount or estimable range of reasonably possible loss, will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows with respect to loss contingencies for legal and other contingencies as of December 31, 2013. However, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's expectations, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period, could be materially adversely affected. Business Combinations and Valuation of Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. During the measurement period, which is one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings. We review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. We have elected to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our single reporting operating unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment under Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-08, Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment, issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). If we determine that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount, then the two-step goodwill impairment test will be performed. The first step, identifying a potential impairment, compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, the second step will be performed; otherwise, no further step is required. The second step, measuring the impairment loss, compares the implied fair value of the goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill. Any excess of the goodwill carrying amount over the applied fair value is recognized as an impairment loss, and the carrying value of goodwill is written down to fair value. As of December 31, 2013, no impairment of goodwill has been identified. Acquired intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We evaluate the recoverability of amortizable intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are 43 expected to generate. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. We have not recorded any such impairment charge during the years presented. In addition to the recoverability assessment, we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our amortizable intangible assets. If we reduce the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized balance would be amortized over the revised estimated useful life. Components of Results of Operations Revenue We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising and from fees associated with our Payments infrastructure that enables users to purchase virtual and digital goods from our developers with applications on the Facebook website. Advertising. Our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on the Facebook website or mobile application and third-party affiliated websites or mobile applications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies, based on the number of clicks made by our users, the number of actions taken by our users or the number of impressions delivered. We recognize revenue from the delivery of click-based ads in the period in which a user clicks on the content, and action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for. We recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. Impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to users. The number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products. Whether we count the initial display only or every display of an ad as an impression is dependent on where the ad is displayed. For example, an individual ad in News Feed that is purchased on an impression basis may be displayed to users more than once during a day; however, only the initial display of the ad is considered an impression, regardless of how many times the ad is actually displayed within the News Feed to a particular user. We calculate price per ad as total ad revenue divided by the number of ads delivered, representing the effective price paid per impression by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression, click, or action. Payments and other fees. We enable Payments from our users to purchase virtual and digital goods from our developers with applications on the Facebook website. Our users can transact and make payments on the Facebook website by using debit and credit cards, PayPal, mobile phone payments, gift cards or other methods. We receive a fee from developers when users make purchases in these applications using our Payments infrastructure. We recognize revenue net of amounts remitted to our developers. We have mandated the use of our Payments infrastructure for game applications on Facebook, and fees related to Payments are generated almost exclusively from games. Our other fees revenue, which has not been significant in recent periods, consists primarily of user Promoted Posts and our ad serving and measurement products. Cost of Revenue and Operating Expenses Cost of revenue. Our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These include expenses related to the operation of our data centers such as facility and server equipment depreciation, facility and server equipment rent expense, energy and bandwidth costs, support and maintenance costs, and salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams. Cost of revenue also includes credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions. Research and development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for building new products as well as improving existing products. We expense all of our research and development costs as they are incurred. Marketing and sales. Our marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, marketing, business development, and customer service functions. Our marketing and sales expenses also include user-, developer-, and marketer-facing marketing and promotional expenditures. General and administrative. Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for our executives as well as our legal, finance, human resources, corporate communications and policy, and other administrative employees. In addition, general and administrative expenses include outside consulting fees, and legal and accounting services. General and administrative expenses also include legal settlements and amortization of patents we acquired. 44 Results of Operations The following table set forth our consolidated statements of income data: Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 (in millions)Consolidated Statements of Income Data:     Revenue$7,872  $5,089  $3,711 Costs and expenses:      Cost of revenue1,875  1,364  860 Research and development1,415  1,399  388 Marketing and sales997  896  393 General and administrative781  892  314 Total costs and expenses5,068  4,551  1,955 Income from operations2,804  538  1,756 Interest and other expense, net(50) (44) (61)Income before provision for income taxes2,754  494  1,695 Provision for income taxes1,254  441  695 Net income$1,500  $53  $1,000 Share-based compensation expense included in costs and expenses: Year Ended December 31,  2013 2012 2011 (in millions)Cost of revenue$42  $88  $9 Research and development604  843  114 Marketing and sales133  306  37 General and administrative127  335  57 Total share-based compensation expense$906  $1,572  $217 The following table set forth our consolidated statements of income data (as a percentage of revenue): Year Ended December 31,   2013 2012 2011Consolidated Statements of Income Data:     Revenue100 % 100 % 100 %Costs and expenses:     Cost of revenue24  27  23 Research and development18  27  10 Marketing and sales13  18  11 General and administrative10  18  8 Total costs and expenses64  89  53 Income from operations36  11  47 Interest and other expense, net(1) (1) (2)Income before provision for income taxes35  10  46 Provision for income taxes16  9  19 Net income19 % 1 % 27 % 45 Share-based compensation expense included in costs and expenses (as a percentage of revenue): Year Ended December 31,   2013 2012 2011Cost of revenue1% 2% —%Research and development8  17  3 Marketing and sales2  6  1 General and administrative2  7  2 Total share-based compensation expense12% 31% 6% Revenue Year Ended December 31,   2013 vs 2012 % Change   2012 vs 2011 % Change   2013 2012 2011     (in millions)    Advertising$6,986  $4,279  $3,154  63% 36%Payments and other fees886  810  557  9% 45%Total revenue$7,872  $5,089  $3,711  55% 37% 2013 Compared to 2012. Revenue in 2013 increased $2.78 billion, or 55% compared to 2012. The increase was due primarily to a 63% increase in advertising revenue during 2013 as compared to 2012. The most important factor driving advertising revenue growth was an increase in revenue from ads in News Feed on both mobile devices and personal computers. News Feed ads are displayed more prominently, have significantly higher levels of engagement and a higher price per ad relative to our other ad placements. In 2013, we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 45% of total advertising revenue, as compared with 11% in 2012. Other factors that influenced our advertising revenue growth in 2013 included an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on Facebook, which we believe increased demand for our ad inventory, and a 22% growth in average DAUs from December 2012 to December 2013. In 2013 compared to 2012, we increased the number of ads shown by 20% and the average price per ad by 36%. The increase in average price per ad was driven primarily by the increased number of News Feed ads on both mobile devices and personal computers, offset partially by product changes including our decision to lower the market reserve price, i.e. the minimum price threshold accepted in our auction. The increase in the number of ads shown was driven by user growth and the reserve price change, partially offset by a shift towards more usage on mobile devices, where we show fewer ads than on personal computers. Advertising revenue in the fourth quarter of 2013 increased 76% compared to the same period in 2012. The increase in ad revenue in the fourth quarter of 2013 was driven by the same factors that drove 2013 annual ad revenue growth, primarily an increase in revenue from ads in News Feed on both mobile devices and personal computers. For the fourth quarter of 2013, we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 53% of total advertising revenue, as compared with 23% in the same period in 2012. Advertising spending is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year. We believe that this seasonality in advertising spending affects our quarterly results, which generally reflect significant growth in advertising revenue between the third and fourth quarters and a decline in advertising spending between the fourth and subsequent first quarters. For instance, our advertising revenue increased 30%, 22%, and 18% between the third and fourth quarters of 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, while advertising revenue for the first quarter of 2013 and 2012 declined 6% and 8% compared to the fourth quarters of 2012 and 2011, respectively. Payments and other fees revenue in 2013 increased $76 million, or 9%, compared to 2012. The increase in Payments and other fees revenue is a result of increased Payments revenue from games played on Facebook on personal computers, and to a lesser extent, the inclusion of other fees revenue in 2013 from user Promoted Posts and our ad serving and measurement products. Payments and other fees revenue in the fourth quarter of 2013 was $241 million, as compared to $256 million in the same period of 2012, which was affected by a one-time increase in Payments revenue in the fourth quarter of 2012. Our Payments terms and conditions provide for a 30-day claim period subsequent to a Payments transaction during which the customer may dispute the virtual or digital goods transaction. Due to lack of historical transactional information, through the third quarter of 2012, we deferred recognition of Payments revenue until the expiration of the claim period as we were unable to make reasonable and reliable estimates 46 of future refunds or chargebacks arising during this period. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2012, we had 24 months of historical transactional information which enabled us to estimate future refunds and chargebacks. Accordingly, commencing in the fourth quarter of 2012, we recorded all Payments revenues at the time of the purchase of the related virtual or digital goods, net of estimated refunds or chargebacks. This change resulted in a one-time increase in Payments revenue in the fourth quarter of 2012 of approximately $66 million as we recognized revenue from four months of transactions. In 2013, we generated approximately 46% of our revenue from marketers and developers based in the United States, compared to 51% in 2012. The change is due to a faster growth rate of international users and to the expansion of international sales offices and payment methods. The majority of our revenue outside of the United States came from customers located in Western Europe, Canada, Australia and Brazil. 2012 Compared to 2011. Revenue in 2012 increased $1.38 billion, or 37% compared to 2011. The increase was due primarily to a 36% increase in advertising revenue during 2012 as compared to 2011. Advertising revenue grew due to a 32% increase in the number of ads delivered during 2012 and to a 3% increase in the average price per ad. The increase in ads delivered was driven primarily by user growth. Average DAUs grew 28% from December 2011 to December 2012 and MAUs grew 25% from December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2012. Various product changes and changes in user engagement generally offset in their impact on the average number of ads per user. For example, the shift to greater mobile use generally reduced ads per user, while the introduction of ads in News Feed increased the number of ads per user. The rate of change in number of ads delivered also differs by geography, driven by factors such as mobile penetration. For example, Europe and Rest of World increased at a faster rate than the United States and Asia. Growth in the average price per ad during 2012 compared to 2011 was driven primarily by an increase in price per ad in the United States, which benefited from growth in ads in News Feed across desktop and mobile devices. Ads in News Feed have a significantly higher average price per ad due to factors which include the prominent position of the ads. The increase in price per ad in the United States was partially offset by an increased percentage of our worldwide ads being delivered in the Asia and Rest of World geographies where the average price per ad, while growing on a year-over-year basis, is relatively lower. The average price per ad was also affected by a decline in the average price per ad in Europe in 2012 compared to 2011 due to the impact of foreign exchange rate changes, an increase in the percentage of ads being delivered in European regions where the average price per ads is relatively lower, and in part, we believe, to continuing weak economic conditions in that region affecting advertiser demand. In 2012, we estimate that mobile advertising revenue as a percentage of advertising revenue was approximately 11%. As mobile advertising was not offered prior to the first quarter of 2012, comparisons to prior year are not meaningful. Payments and other fees revenue in 2012 increased $253 million, or 45%, compared to 2011. Excluding the one-time increase in Payments revenue described above, Payments and other fees revenue in 2012 increased 34% compared to 2011. Facebook Payments became mandatory for all game developers accepting payments on the Facebook website with limited exceptions on July 1, 2011. Accordingly, comparisons of Payments and other fees revenue to periods before this date may not be meaningful. In 2012, we generated approximately 51% of our revenue from marketers and developers based in the United States, compared to 56% in 2011. The change is due primarily to a faster growth rate of international users and, to a lesser extent, to the expansion of international sales offices and payment methods. The majority of our revenue outside of the United States came from customers located in western Europe, Canada, Australia and Brazil. No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 and one customer represented 12% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011. Cost of revenue Year Ended December 31,       2013 2012 2011 2013 vs 2012 % Change   2012 vs 2011 % Change   (dollars in millions)    Cost of revenue$1,875  $1,364  $860  37% 59%Percentage of revenue24% 27% 23% 2013 Compared to 2012. Cost of revenue in 2013 increased $511 million, or 37%, compared to 2012. The increase was primarily due to operational expenses related to expanding our data center and technical infrastructure, including a $275 million increase in depreciation in 2013. In addition, we recognized $117 million of lease abandonment expense in 2013 primarily due to exiting certain 47 leased data centers resulting from the migration of operations to our own data centers. In the event that circumstances change such that we decide to re-occupy and utilize any of the data centers we have exited, we would reverse the remaining lease abandonment liability associated with those facilities. The increase in cost of revenue in 2013 was partially offset by a $46 million decrease in share-based compensation expense compared to 2012 mainly due to the recognition of expense in the prior period related to Pre-2011 RSUs as a result of our IPO in May 2012. 2012 Compared to 2011. Cost of revenue in 2012 increased $504 million, or 59%, compared to 2011. The increase was primarily due to expenses related to expanding our data center operations, including a $257 million increase in depreciation in 2012. Share-based compensation expense increased by $79 million in 2012 compared to 2011 mainly due to the recognition of expenses related to Pre-2011 RSUs triggered by the completion of our IPO in May 2012 and, to a lesser extent, Post-2011 RSUs. Increases in payroll and benefits expenses resulting from a 65% increase in employee headcount also contributed to the increase in cost of revenue in 2012. These expenses supported our user growth, the increased usage of products by users, developers, and marketers, and the launch of new products. We anticipate that the cost of revenue will increase in dollar amount in 2014 and for the foreseeable future as we expand our data center capacity and technical infrastructure to support user growth, increased user engagement, and the delivery of new products and offerings. The expected increase in cost of revenue may be partially mitigated to the extent we are able to realize improvements in server and network performance and the efficiency of our technical operations. Research and development Year Ended December 31,       2013 2012 2011 2013 vs 2012 % Change   2012 vs 2011 % Change   (dollars in millions)    Research and development$1,415  $1,399  $388  1% 261%Percentage of revenue18% 27% 10% 2013 Compared to 2012. Research and development expenses in 2013 increased $16 million, or 1%, compared to 2012. The increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll and benefits expense resulting from a 50% growth in employee headcount from December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2013 in engineering and other technical functions. This increase in 2013 was offset by a $239 million decrease in share-based compensation expense compared to 2012 mainly due to the recognition of expense in the prior period related to Pre-2011 RSUs as a result of our IPO in May 2012. 2012 Compared to 2011. Research and development expenses in 2012 increased $1.01 billion, or 261%, compared to 2011. The increase was primarily due to an increase in share-based compensation expense of $729 million in 2012 resulting primarily from the recognition of expenses related to Pre-2011 RSUs triggered by the completion of our IPO in May 2012 and, to a lesser extent, Post-2011 RSUs. Payroll and benefits expense also increased due to a 73% growth in employee headcount in engineering, design, product management, and other technical functions. This investment supported our efforts to improve existing products and build new products for users, developers, and marketers. In 2014, we plan to continue hiring software engineers and other technical employees. We expect research and development expenses will rise in 2014 at a higher rate than it rose in 2013 due to the large share-based compensation expense in 2012 associated with Pre-2011 RSUs as a result of our IPO which lowered the growth rate between 2012 and 2013. Marketing and sales Year Ended December 31,       2013 2012 2011 2013 vs 2012 % Change   2012 vs 2011 % Change   (dollars in millions)    Marketing and sales$997  $896  $393  11% 128%Percentage of revenue13% 18% 11% 2013 Compared to 2012. Marketing and sales expenses in 2013 increased $101 million, or 11%, compared to 2012. The increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll and benefits expenses resulting from a 36% increase in employee headcount from December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2013 to support global sales, business development and customer service. Our user-, developer-, and marketer-facing marketing expense also contributed to the increase in 2013. These increases in 2013 were partially offset by a decrease 48 in share-based compensation expense of $173 million compared to 2012 primarily due to the recognition of expense in the prior period related to Pre-2011 RSUs as a result of our IPO in May 2012. 2012 Compared to 2011. Marketing and sales expenses in 2012 increased $503 million, or 128%, compared to 2011. The increase was primarily due to an increase in share-based compensation expense of $269 million in 2012 resulting primarily from the recognition of expenses related to Pre-2011 RSUs triggered by the completion of our IPO in May 2012 and, to a lesser extent, Post-2011 RSUs. Payroll and benefits expenses also increased due to a 19% increase in employee headcount to support global sales, business development and customer service. An increase in our user-, developer-, and marketer-facing marketing expense also contributed to the increase in 2012. In 2014, we plan to add sales and business development employees, and increase our investment in user-, developer-, and marketer-facing marketing. We expect marketing and sales expenses will rise in 2014 at a higher rate than it rose in 2013 due to the large share-based compensation expense in 2012 associated with Pre-2011 RSUs as a result of our IPO which lowered the growth rate between 2012 and 2013. General and administrative Year Ended December 31,       2013 2012 2011 2013 vs 2012 % Change   2012 vs 2011 % Change   (dollars in millions)    General and administrative$781  $892  $314  (12)% 184%Percentage of revenue10% 18% 8% 2013 Compared to 2012. General and administrative expenses in 2013 decreased $111 million, or 12%, compared to 2012. The decrease was primarily due to a $208 million decrease in share-based compensation expense in 2013 compared to 2012 resulting from recognition of expense related to Pre-2011 RSUs as a result of our IPO in May 2012. The decrease in 2013 was partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense resulting from a 19% increase in employee headcount and increased amortization of acquired patents. 2012 Compared to 2011. General and administrative expenses in 2012 increased $578 million, or 184%, compared to 2011. The increase was primarily due to an increase in share-based compensation expense of $278 million resulting from recognition of expense related to Pre-2011 RSUs and, to a lesser extent, Post-2011 RSUs. The increase was also due to growth in legal fees and settlement costs, amortization of acquired patents and other professional service fees. Payroll and benefits expenses also increased for 2012 due to a 38% increase in employee headcount in corporate communications and policy, human resources, legal, finance, and other functions. In 2014, we expect general and administrative expenses will grow relative to 2013 as we continue to increase general and administrative employee headcount to support our growth. Interest and other expense, net Year Ended December 31,       2013 2012 2011 2013 vs 2012 % Change   2012 vs 2011 % Change   (in millions)    Interest expense$(56) $(51) $(42) 10 % 21 %Other income (expense), net6  7  (19) (14)% 137 %Interest and other expense, net$(50) $(44) $(61) 14 % (28)% 2013 Compared to 2012. Interest and other expense, net in 2013 increased $6 million, or 14%, compared to 2012. Interest expense increased by $5 million primarily due to interest on the $1.5 billion term loan that was drawn down in the fourth quarter of 2012 and fully repaid in August 2013. Other income, net in 2013 decreased $1 million compared to 2012 primarily due to an increase in foreign exchange loss resulting from the periodic re-measurement of our foreign currency balances, offset by an increase in interest income resulting from higher invested cash balances. 2012 Compared to 2011. Interest and other expense, net in 2012 decreased $17 million, or 28%, compared to 2011. Interest expense increased by $9 million primarily due to an increased volume of property and equipment financed by capital leases for 2012 49 and interest on the $1.5 billion term loan that was drawn down in the fourth quarter of 2012. Changes in other income (expense), net were primarily due to lower foreign exchange losses in 2012 resulting from the periodic re-measurement of our foreign currency balances and an increase in interest income driven by higher invested cash balances. Provision for income taxes Year Ended December 31,       2013 2012 2011 2013 vs 2012 % Change   2012 vs 2011 % Change   (dollars in millions)    Provision for income taxes$1,254  $441  $695  184% (37)%Effective tax rate46% 89% 41% 2013 Compared to 2012. Our provision for income taxes in 2013 increased $813 million, or 184%, compared to 2012, primarily due to an increase in pretax income. Our effective tax rate decreased primarily due to a lower amount of non-deductible share-based compensation resulting from recognition of expense related to Pre-2011 RSUs as a result of our IPO in May 2012. Our effective tax rate in 2013 was also lower due to the reinstatement in 2013 of the federal tax credit for research and development activities. We recognized the benefit from the reinstatement of the tax credit for 2012 and 2013 during the year ended December 31, 2013. 2012 Compared to 2011. Our provision for income taxes in 2012 decreased $254 million, or 37%, compared to 2011, primarily due to a decrease in pretax income. Our effective tax rate increased primarily due to the impact of non-deductible share-based compensation and the losses arising outside the United States in jurisdictions where we do not receive a tax benefit. Our effective tax rate in 2012 was also higher due to the expiration of the federal tax credit for research and development activities. 50 Quarterly Results of Operations Data The following tables set forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of operations data in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue for each of the eight quarters in the period ended December 31, 2013. We have prepared the quarterly consolidated statements of operations data on a basis consistent with the audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, the financial information reflects all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, which we consider necessary for a fair presentation of this data. This information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for any future period.

This charge resulted in a one-time increase in Payment revenue of $66 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. (2)In the second quarter of 2012, we recognized $986 million of share-based compensation expense related to Pre-2011 RSUs that vested in connection with our IPO.

Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of cash on deposit with banks and investments in money market funds and U.S. government and U.S. government agency securities. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $11.45 billion as of December 31, 2013, an increase of $1.82 billion from December 31, 2012, primarily due to $4.22 billion of cash generated from operations, $1.48 billion of net proceeds from our follow-on equity offering which was completed in December 2013, and $609 million in excess tax benefit from share-based award activity, offset by the repayment of our $1.5 billion term loan, $1.36 billion for purchases of property and equipment and $889 million for tax payments related to net share settlement of equity awards. In January 2014, we began requiring that employees sell a portion of the shares that they receive upon the vesting of RSUs in order to cover any required withholding taxes ("sell-to-cover"), rather than our previous approach of net share settlement. We expect this sell-to-cover approach will reduce our cash outflows. We currently anticipate that our available funds, credit facilities, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future. In August 2013, in connection with the termination of our existing credit facilities, we entered into a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (2013 Revolving Credit Facility) that allows us to borrow up to $6.5 billion to fund working capital and general corporate purposes with interest payable on the borrowed amounts set at LIBOR plus 1.0%, as well as an annual commitment fee of 0.10% on the daily undrawn balance of the facility. We paid origination fees at closing of the 2013 Revolving Credit Facility, which fees are being amortized over the term of the facility. Any amounts outstanding under this facility will be due and payable on August 15, 2018. As of December 31, 2013, no amounts had been drawn down and we were in compliance with the covenants under this credit facility. See Note 9 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for additional detail. As of December 31, 2013, $634 million of the $11.45 billion in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. We have provided for the additional taxes that would be due if we repatriated these funds for use in our operations in the United States. 53 Cash Provided by Operating Activities Cash flow from operating activities during 2013 primarily consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization of $1.01 billion and share-based compensation expense of $906 million, and an increase in other liabilities related to uncertain tax positions. The cash flow from operating activities during 2013 compared to 2012 increased mainly due to an increase in net income of $1.45 billion and uncertain tax position of $786 million. In addition, we received income tax refunds of $421 million in 2013. Cash flow from operating activities during 2012 primarily consisted of adjustments to net income for certain non-cash items such as share-based compensation expense of $1.57 billion and depreciation and amortization of $649 million, partially offset by income tax refundable of $451 million. The cash flow from operating activities during 2012 compared to 2011 increased modestly as the increases in adjustments for non-cash items as described above were offset by a reduction in net income of $947 million and an increase in income tax refundable. Cash flow from operating activities during 2011 primarily consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization of $323 million and share-based compensation expense of $217 million. Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities during 2013 primarily resulted from $1.36 billion for capital expenditures related to the purchase of servers, network infrastructure, and the construction of data centers, as well as $882 million for the net purchase of marketable securities and $368 million for the acquisition of businesses and other assets, such as patents. The decrease in cash used in investing activities during 2013 compared to 2012 was mainly due to decreases in the purchase of marketable securities and the acquisition of businesses and other assets. Cash used in investing activities during 2012 primarily resulted from $4.87 billion for the net purchase of marketable securities, $1.24 billion for capital expenditures related to the purchase of servers, network infrastructure, and the construction of data centers, as well as $911 million for the acquisition of businesses and other assets, such as patents. The increase in cash used in investing activities during 2012 compared to 2011 was mainly due to increases in the purchase of marketable securities, the acquisition of businesses and other assets, and capital expenditures. Cash used in investing activities during 2011 primarily resulted from the use of approximately $2.4 billion for the net purchase of marketable securities. Our cash used in investing activities in 2011 also consisted of capital expenditures of $606 million related to the purchase of servers, network infrastructure, and the construction of data centers. We anticipate making capital expenditures in 2014 of approximately $2.0 billion to $2.5 billion. Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities during 2013 was $667 million, which primarily resulted from $1.5 billion for repayment of debt and $889 million of tax payments related to the net share settlement of equity awards, partially offset by $1.48 billion in net proceeds from the completion of our follow-on equity offering in December 2013. Cash provided by financing activities during 2012 was $6.28 billion, which primarily resulted from $6.8 billion in net proceeds from the completion of our IPO, $1.5 billion draw down from our unsecured term loan facility and $1.03 billion of excess tax benefits from stock award activities, partially offset by $2.86 billion of taxes paid related to the net share settlement of equity awards. Cash provided by financing activities during 2011 was $1.2 billion, primarily resulted from $998 million in net proceeds related to the completion of an offering of our Class A common stock to certain non-U.S. investors. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2013. 54 Contractual Obligations Our principal commitments consist of obligations under capital and operating leases for equipment and office and data center facilities. The following table summarizes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of December 31, 2013. Payment Due by Period  Total Less than  1 Year 1-3  Years 3-5  Years  More than  5 Years Operating lease obligations$978  $142  $281  $243  $312 Capital lease obligations561  255  148  31  127 Other contractual commitments(1)258  116  40  16  86 Total contractual obligations$1,797  $513  $469  $290  $525 _____________________ (1)Other contractual commitments primarily relate to network infrastructure for our data center operations and, to a lesser extent, construction commitments related to our data center sites. In addition, our other liabilities include $886 million related to uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2013. Due to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months. As a result, this amount is not included in the above contractual obligations table. Contingencies We are involved in claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and proceedings. We record a provision for a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. Such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. See Note 10 in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" and Part I, Item 3, "Legal Proceedings" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding contingencies. Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncement Comprehensive Income In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (ASU 2013-02) which is effective prospectively for public companies for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012. This new accounting standard improves the reporting of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) by requiring an entity to report the effect of significant reclassifications out of AOCI on the respective line items in net income if the amount being reclassified is required under GAAP to be reclassified in its entirety to net income. For other amounts that are not required under GAAP to be reclassified in their entirety to net income in the same reporting period, an entity is required to cross-reference other disclosures required under GAAP that provide additional detail about those amounts. We adopted this new guidance on January 1, 2013 and the adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 55
