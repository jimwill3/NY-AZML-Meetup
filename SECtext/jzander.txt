Executives
Jason Zander - EVP, Microsoft Azure
Analysts
Brad Zelnick - Credit Suisse
Brad Zelnick
I’m Brad Zelnick, I’m the software analyst here at Credit Suisse. And we’re truly delighted to have with us today Jason Zander from Microsoft Corporation for our software keynote this morning. Jason is Executive Vice President of Microsoft Azure business. He has been with Microsoft since 1992, started out in engineering. Before Azure, I think you ran the Visual Studio business.
Jason Zander
That’s correct.
Question-and-Answer Session
Q - Brad Zelnick
And really, really excited to have you. Why don’t we get comfortable, format of today. Presentation is going to be a fireside chat, and we’re going to see what we can learn about Microsoft’s efforts in the public cloud. So, Jason may be just to open it up, get to my notes, but I know what I wanted to ask you. Microsoft mission statement, it’s quite bold. And every time I open up your filings or listen to Satya speak, and I’m reminded to empower every person in every organization on the planet to achieve more. With that I just think boundless opportunities. But as it relates to Azure, what is unique about Azure that best enables you to deliver on this very bold vision?
Jason Zander
Yes. And thank you Brad for having me here today as well and good morning everybody. I would say there are several things that I would point out, but I want to start off from an Azure perspective and I’d really push on hybrid. Hybrid is something that we have made part of our product plan since day one. And some of that comes from the fact that we had 20 years experience providing software into data centers, data center and enterprise environments, and there we've done the hyperscale cloud. And so, that's a really great new solution that we have. And we’ve done everything full spread on hybrid. We also have a very broad portfolio. So, going even beyond Azure, we of course have Office 365. When you think about how one uses that, I have Azure Active Directory, so I have identity, I have security et cetera. And the products all come together. So, the Microsoft cloud, if we look at Office 365, dynamics and the identity that underpins all of this, all of these things compose well. The last thing I would say is it’s not even really a technical differentiator. But, we are a software company. And one of the key things I always tell potential customers and partners, we’re not your competition. We’re here to help support you in a world where I think a lot of customers that I talk to, they don't want to get technology on one hand from provider and have that provider turn around and compete with them on another. And so, us just being at the core, having at breadth that hybrid, those are differentiators that I think resonate.
Brad Zelnick
Excellent. And if we think about your global presence, 54 global regions, the largest presence in the marketplace as I understand it. As we think about the various data centers that comprise those regions and we think about that driving your success, is there a theoretical limit to the number of regions that we should expect? And how do you think about the decision to expand further into different areas?
Jason Zander
Yes. This one is kind of region how we’ve gotten into cloud as well. I mean, with 54 regions worldwide, these are the big hyperscale regions that we run, always big workloads. Now, we do this in order to get close as possible to your potential customers, as well as your employees. And so, being able to be in these regions around the world is super important. Also, having more region count helps us with things data sovereignty. Now, if you think about our history in cloud, one of the key reasons we need to do that, we’re doing Office 365 in one of the first big commercial SaaS services out there, most popular one out there today. And it turns out if you're doing people’s emails and SharePoint document et cetera, you need to be close and you need to have that kind of coverage. And so, we’ve done that worldwide thing since day one. If you think about it, if I was a retailer and I was only serving a couple of markets, I don’t really need that. So, I’d start off with a smaller footprint. If I was just doing search, you don't need full coverage. In fact, even with Bing, we really only have about five regions around the world that we run Bing out of. We have full coverage, but it’s just -- if I am searching the internet and you’re searching for Laugh-Out-Loud Cats, I don’t need to worry about having one in Luxemburg, right. So, you can just basically service it that way.

So, our history is kind of rooted in that. That’s one of the other ways we chose to differentiate because we needed it. We recognize customers and ISVs with worldwide reach needed it. And so, from a theoretical limit, right now, 54 regions is the ones we’ve announced. We do have more that are underway, we haven’t disclosed yet, I expect us to continue to do that. There's a point at which probably don't need to put the data center every single location that would be cost prohibited. And we have good solutions in regions, like the European Union and UK after Brexit and things like that as well. And then, we move into things like Azure Stack, which allow people to get down to the very last mile. If you want one in the basement of Parliament, we can help you out.
Brad Zelnick
Jason, as we think about your CapEx investments, I think everybody -- many in this room, we look and listen very carefully what Microsoft is doing, and where it’s allocating its capital, but specific to the Azure business and the buildouts that you do, can you maybe talk a little bit about your capacity planning process, how it's evolved over time, and how do you approach and cycle time might be different today versus what it was years ago.
Jason Zander
And let’s look at it over top level. I think the interesting thing from a business perspective, the TAM here is just huge. I mean, it’s a tectonic shift. 26 years at Microsoft and I lived through DOS to Windows and I was when Office was created. This might be the biggest one I have seen even with that kind of background. So, the TAM is actually huge. And we are, no question, taking share in growing, which is fantastic. And so, we do expect that our capital spend or CapEx will continue to rise because we’re meeting that demand. I need to go do that. The other thing to remember is when I build out for Azure I’m also doing on behalf of the Microsoft properties. So, when we expand these data centers, all the servers we put in the networking connectivity that we do, we’re also serving Office 365. We’re even serving Xbox. I can watch kids come home on the East Coast and go to the West Coast because I can see when Xbox picks up and then you have to go to your homework and then it drops down there and then in Southern California it’s up again. So, we’re supporting all of these kind platforms. So, that capital spend is for all of us but it’s built on top of Azure as a core. And then of course, there are customers that aren’t Microsoft properties that are running on top of it. So, expect that to go.
Your question was then around efficiencies and how are we dealing with this. And so, we’re absolutely -- every semester do semester planning. I book new wins on cogs improvements. That includes things like tightening up our supply chain, our capacity planning, getting better and better and figuring out what the windows are and long range positioning, and kind of your 101 stuff on that. And I would say we’ve grown so massively that we’re also now trying to grow those internal systems, we get more and more efficiencies over time as we continue to go do that. There’s lots of different angles in there you can pick a part, for any rule of thumb to think about a dollar spent today versus a dollar five years ago or five years from now and the productivity that you would expect to get out of it. Yes. We absolutely -- the kind of the real core of that is, are we getting more efficient, and the answer is absolutely. We’re absolutely getting more efficient as we go through.
Couple of different things we do. One, like I said, shortening lead times and being able to do a better job of predicting where capacity comes through is something we concentrate on heavily. We have won some pretty massive deals. I mean, I would say the cloud has transitioned. We had cases where people would come in and run risk management and do 100,000 cores and run those through. But you are now getting into the largest enterprises that are replacing entire data centers; that winds up being a huge shift. So, we do a lot of intentional planning, getting efficiencies on that. And then, within the fleet itself, we look at a combination of utilization, our power utilization, et cetera. We have machine learning algorithms that we run internally to optimize all the stuff. So, we’re making some usage of that. Plus, we do a lot around our skew mix and things like that as well. So, you can get the best possible planning. We even do this of course at a worldwide scale. So, all of those things are actually part of what we're doing for efficiencies. And we get better and better and better over time.

Brad Zelnick
And just to pivot to a different topic that is, I know on just about everybody's minds. In the headlines all the time is security. And security is clearly an important design criterion for any cloud service and it’s becoming more and more topical and part of Microsoft’s message. And no matter how much we spend on security, some estimate, $80 billion, $90 billion, $100 billion a year, we continue to wake up with these breaches. What does Microsoft see in specific to Microsoft Cloud as your responsibility, how much of this is opportunity in its own right versus something that needs to be inherent in your platform?
Jason Zander
Yes. This is super important one. Obviously, security’s never been more important, especially as we have even more connectivity, devices around the web and they wind up taking even more control over some of our everyday functions that we all interact with. Now, I think the estimates that I’ve seen are in 2020, the world economy could hit by about $1 trillion worth of impact from cyber security. Wow! Okay. So, we need to make sure we’re all doing a very, very good job on that.
From a Microsoft perspective, we spend about a $1 billion [ph] in R&D, that’s all of our professional engineers, men and women that are working on these tasks. We have over 3,500 full time employees that only do security, our digital crimes units and all the rest of that kind of stuff that we do, 3,500 full time employees that are there. Now, one of the interesting things to think about from security from a Microsoft perspective, we see a lot of unique signals around the globe. We see, for example, everyone using Office 365, we have to produce security technology to protect our own customers and our own product, and we invest in that. We have 1.2 billion sockets out there with Windows, which we see that as well. And you probably have seen Microsoft publicly work with law enforcement agencies around the world to take down illegal botnets, phishing sites and all those sort of bad actors, again part of that security investment we do.
Now, from a cloud perspective, think about how old those signals, and we did about 6.5 billion signals a day. We pull all of those signals in that we see, for own products on the public net as well as things from the crime, the botnets and all the rest of that stuff, and we included in our own data and analytics, we run machine learning algorithms over, we figure out bad patterns and anti-patterns, and that’s how we protect our own properties, Office and Xbox and then we turn around and make those market questions. We take some of the same tact to protect our own customers and we make some of those products that are available for our customers that they can also have those advanced protection as well. So, that’s -- those are just some examples of some of the things that we invest in. And as you pointed out, the bar is going to continue to go up.
Brad Zelnick
In terms of monetizing that investment, can we expect increasingly we will see you going after security dollars earmarked within a customer budget versus monetizing just the adoption of customers feeling more confident in Office 365 and Azure and all the various cloud services that you offer, implicit versus explicit? Sorry.
Jason Zander
Sure. No, absolutely. Yes. And I think you should think of this as over time we’ll continue to evolve. And so in some ways, security is at table stakes. You have to have security in your cloud, and we do. It’s going to be built in. So, as you see the kind of refactoring of that kind of value proposition that the cloud brings, I mean, you’re no longer worrying about your hardware, you’re no longer worrying about the underlying management. That just comes with -- of course, a certain element of security has to just come with, that's the table stakes part of it, and we provide that as well. So, some default protection is just got to be in there, people could take advantage of it. That would be something as you point out would be recognized more through people leveraging infrastructure as a service and our Azure service offerings, the database to PaaS. That’s just a core part of what is built-in.

Now that said, today, if you're protecting -- if the CIO is looking at a portfolio, how she's running your data center. Chances are she’s actually leveraging 12 separate products from lots of vendors, stitching a bunch of the stuff together and trying to figure how to go make all of that stuff work. And you’re paying for those products that are there. A certain amount of that value will waterfall into that’s just part of what the cloud provides, but there is a lot of advanced threat analytics that's available for that and we expect that people can and will want to be able to do that. So, our strategy here is twofold. One, you will see us introduce products, I mentioned Azure Security Center; there’s also Office as a threat analyzer as well for O365. There’s a bunch of this technology that we expect that customers will want that value because it helps protect them, in some cases simplify that portfolio that was mentioned.
Now, I also have a very strong IC ecosystem. So, those 12 products that our CIO was using, in her data centers, it turns out in this hybrid state where we expect to see hybrid across the board, we want to make sure we’re meeting where she is and then also working with those ICs, so they can bring their product along as well. So, I think you’ll see us core table stakes, we have some of our own differentiated offerings that we think simplify the world and really do a good job managing out there but then we’re also going to have that healthy ecosystem that helps everybody to bridge the gap and for those ISVs to also modernize their products.
Brad Zelnick
Excellent, thank you so much. In your opener, Jason, you talked about hybrid as being a distinct attribute and differentiator for your offering. And as I also think about intelligent cloud, that’s often talked about in the context as well as intelligent edge, many people talk about edge computing being the next generation of growth and opportunity in technology more broadly. And as we think about edge there is going to be various players, there is going to be horizontal winners, there are going to be various players, there are going to be horizontal winners, there are going to be specific specialized edge players, like security edge players et cetera. And I've heard from Satya all the way and down through the rest the organization, examples like precision agriculture, precision medicine. Can you talk a bit about the edge opportunity as you see it today, why is it so important and why is Microsoft so well positioned to capture it?
Jason Zander
That’s a great one. And you will see our worldview at Microsoft, and we've used this framing for the last couple of years actually and actually -- we captured quite well. We got the worldview of the intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge. Why do you do that? I think, one thing you need to -- the cloud on the back end is really kind of your substrate. I mean, it knows who I am, no matter what device I'm using, whether it’s my phone or tablet of my car. I mean -- so the cloud helps with that, gives us that global reach, that maximum processing power. The edge that you point out is all different sorts of form factors that we have available for that. And so, that could be anything from again the devices that we are all carrying, the stuff on the table or in your bag, out to things like the centers that are running this building, I mean all of those things to be part of that edge. The intelligence piece has to come down to -- we do believe it has to be smart. I mean, we can’t just have a bunch of signals coming off of dumb devices, we will have essential measures, those things have to be there. But, we also want smarts at the edge. My favorite example of this, if you think about self driving cars, like there's a point at which we want enough smarts on board, so that if that car sees a red bouncing ball come out in front of, it hits the break right away, just like you would as the driver because there is a high probability there is a kid coming up right behind it. Like, I don’t want that making round trip to the cloud to figure out, should I hit the brakes, is that okay, I mean like, no, I mean like, do it right then and right there.

So, I think that intelligence piece is something that’s super important. So, that’s a topical taxonomy. And let’s just mention the kind of hybrid aspects of this, I think that plays in and then we can come back to the edge if that’s okay.
From a hybrid perspective, what does this mean? It means that you are going to have -- again think about that edge taxonomy. I’m going to have this hybrid kind of solution, and this has again been part of our solution since day one. And we think that hybrid is super important. That’s identify, it’s your data, it’s your security, and then it’s also the form factors. It’s not just, can I run a couple of software applications here or there. It’s got to be all those things put together. And that’s been a core part of what we’ve done. Our hybrid offerings are actually really, really strong. And again, it comes from 20 years of experience of having actually done software for data centers. And we’re structurally positioned quite well, no matter what that mix looks like for a customer.
In particular, I will tell you one really great example, we are seeing -- we have the single Azure Hybrid benefit. What that means is you can take your assay license for Windows Server or SQL server, you can run that on premises but you can also bring it with you to the Azure cloud and only the Azure cloud. And if you look at that from a pricing perspective, that means running that workload with that assay, Amazon could be up to five times more expensive for that same work load. So, I’m seeing this really good dynamic in the market which is there is a lot of people that have server workloads that might be running SQL server around the 2008 product lines, and those are coming to end of service. So, we’re having a lot of conversations with customers right now about how do I modernize, do I just like upgrade it in place on my existing equipment, but I was also doing a data center migration. And if I can come along and give you Azure hybrid benefits, I can help you actually pull that path forward, you can actually run it flexibly and much cheaper than I am seeing a whole bunch of companies that are now starting to zero in on cash. Maybe this is a great time to move those workloads, get them modernized up to the latest version, kind of get an evergreen solution across the cloud with the savings, great combination. So, those are just some examples, and then Azure Stack is both sides. Let me stop here on hybrid, because I want to get back to your edge question.
Brad Zelnick
Please.
Jason Zander
So from the edge -- so, that’s the base. I wanted to go hit that, just so you can see how that lines up. Now, with that in the background, okay. So, now, I’ve got this combination of the cloud -- I’ve got the hybrid components like I can run with my own data centers. Now I can get into things like Azure Stack which is again our third generation appliance that we've actually done. I joined Azure in 2012 and already had that as part of our strategy back then which has been there since day one. So, now I can start getting to this edge thing. But, let’s take a great example like a connected battery, it’s one of my favorites. Because if you think about a factory, it’s out there and running it, staffing a production line in a factory could cost me a $1 million a minute, or an hour depending upon what you’re doing, but it could be really, really expensive to be able to do that. And so, now, like let’s get an IC scenario, when I come back onto the edge, I can have a combination of my controllers and things on the floor hooked up, but I can put an Azure Stack on the shop floor, make sure that everything is nice and connected, even if there’s a fiber connection, massive store hurricane, I don’t know something like that, my factory keeps running. And because of the intelligent edge part, I am also doing a lot of the AI and the machine learning locally. We've actually got people doing production manufacturing. Jabil is a good example. They’ve put cameras on their production line, they actually take pictures of components as they go through the different manufacturing stage, and they use ML models to actually look at what should it look like and what isn’t it, so, image recognition. And it’ll actually flag defects early and fix the line as it goes. That's a great example of intelligent edge right there. But now I guess Azure Stack components, and those things come together. And then, of course those same machines, the things I’m running in the factory, I can upload all the logs into the public cloud, hyperscale cloud, cheap storage, lot’s of compute and I can start running big analytics jobs to tune my production runs, like, is it worst manufacturing in Germany in the middle of December if it’s been cold for five days in a row, it could be depends upon your factory and your materials but I can make those decisions and tune it.

So, when you put all the stuff together I believe we have this really awesome solution for all of this. It all dovetails quite well. It’s been part of the strategy since day one. And I mentioned the industrial one, because we absolutely have a lead in industrial IoT with Azure IoT. We’ve got over 70 major partners, if you look at things like Schneider and Johnson, and GE, and Siemens, and all the rest of these folks that do that part of the house and then also companies, I mentioned Jabil, the Cummins, even coffeemakers and stuff like that that do this in factories. So, that’s kind of like the worldview, now apply to smart cities and smart buildings and smart everything, and it’s kind of like that. It sounds like the possibilities become endless, really cool, I love it.
Brad Zelnick
As it all comes together and I appreciate the consistency of Azure Stack with a very seamless experience as it relates to Azure Cloud, and the customer benefit that they get with Azure hybrid benefits. As it all comes together and enables customers to adopt the architecture that's best for them based on their requirements and constraints, I know everybody -- every investor in this room and whoever's listening in has made a bet on what that rate and pace of cloud migration looks like. When we look back at 3, 5 years, 10 years down the road, how much of the enterprise estate will be "on-premise versus the cloud”, however you define that. I’d be curious from all the data that you look at all with your experience, what is your worldview on where -- I mean, we just saw IBM make massive acquisition and Red Hat and one of the justifications being hey, only 20% or so of the enterprise today lives in public cloud. What are your thoughts here?
Jason Zander
This is one -- and I mentioned this hybrid taxonomy but we actually view this again since day one as it is more of a persistent hybrid state. We’ve never viewed this as snap your fingers in some number, everybody is in the hyperscale cloud. In fact this factory example that I gave, smart city critical structure, that’s an example, you’re always going to be in a hybrid mode. And we’ve always anticipated and expected that that would be there. That’s why it’s been our strategy since day one, and we’ve made that investment. So, from that perspective, we’re going to help customers meet whatever that demand looks like. I think there’s places where what I'm seeing is people really looking at the hyperscale cloud as a great way to go run their workloads and they are seeing the cost savings as hybrid benefit I mentioned, keeping up to date, being able to actually save money. Those are things that are absolutely driving that growth in the hyperscale piece.
And then from a on -premises side, like I mentioned, all the way down to sometime sovereignty or disconnected scenarios, those things you’re absolutely going to want to run things that way. The good news, if you think about evaluating our product portfolio and how we’re operating, we’re structurally set up well for all of it. We've been doing the on-premise stuff for 20 years. A lot of the world’s workloads run on our software. And so the fact that we have those assets and we have parlayed that as part of our strategy into the cloud with symmetry between them, really set us up to be the first class thing.
You mentioned some of the M&A activity. In some ways what I’m seeing now is a lot of folks that frankly there is a lot of hybrid washing originally that have a slide on it but it really just meant put your workloads in my data center and then we’re happy and there is a pilot that says hybrid, not really hybrid. And I’m starting to see some of those -- some validation actually back on our strategy with some of the moves that we’ve made. So I think you’re seeing a lot more in market where people are now trying to get back to where we started with hybrid. In some cases, vendors that never actually made it into the hyperscale public cloud; in other cases, hyperscale cloud companies going to partnerships to try and figure out well, okay, great. How do I back track and get some of this stuff on board. And so, you’re seeing more and more of that coming through. It’s something I just view that as a validation of the strategy we’ve been on since day one.

With respect to the IBM and Red Hat, which is the last comment that you made from there. What I would tell you is we’ve got a really good relationship with Red Hat that’s been going really well. We’ve got great adoption of RHEL, the Enterprise Linux. We actually created differentiated support solutions with Red Hat. We have Red Hat engineers on the Microsoft site. So, if a customer calls up, they have an issue, you’re going to talk to both of us. You don’t have to get phone tag. That’s a unique thing that we’ve had with Red Hat. We had a ton of mutual customers and we’re going to keep supporting our customers. Frankly from that perspective, the news doesn't really change that. We’re going to keep up with that momentum; we’re going to keep supporting our customers.
Brad Zelnick
On that topic, Microsoft has embraced open architecture over the last several years in a way that five, six years ago I think nobody could have imagined. Why is this so critical to the strategy?
Jason Zander
Yes, and we have and hopefully people are seeing this kind of cultural transformation with Microsoft. This is more kind of our attitude, how we work with partners. And in some ways I think of again with the benefit of a couple of decades as the company, kind of a maturation of how we won them, just wisdom kind of gained I hope. And I hope people see that. I would say part of this also is I want to make sure from a open source perspective, we are going to meet our customers where they live. And they are absolutely using open source that's important. I want to make sure I got first class solution for that, and we do. We have a higher run rate now for Linux creates and virtual machines in the public cloud; it’s massive. So, that means we’re going to support things like the operating systems but also the middleware, the developer stacks, the devop tools, all of those parts of the stacks that need to be there. We’re also -- and this surprises people sometimes. We’re also a huge contributor to open source. In fact, there is over 16,000 full-time Microsoft engineers that contribute into GitHub; it’s actually the highest of any corporation out there, so you can see that. So, we’ve actually really embraced that. We’re supporting the entire thing.
Again, I think it’s really about that customer choice and enabling it, and really at the end of the day, the platform we’re having to go towards is the cloud. And we want to make sure all of your workloads run on top of it.
Brad Zelnick
Just while we’re on this topic, thanks Jason, the relationship that you’ve had in embracing Red Hat, and open source and Linux, specific to the IBM deal, is there any thoughts in terms of what impact that may or may not have and the way that you think about Red Hat going forward as an IBM company?
Jason Zander
Yes. And as I said, we have a huge overlap I believe with customers. And that was what really drove us to have the deeper relationship with Red Hat where historically maybe it wasn't such a deep relationship; over the last few years, it’s been actually really great. We’ve had really good programs on that. And so, given that we have those mutual customers in there, then we’re actually going to continue support those customers. I believe Red Hat is going to want to be able to do the same thing. They have their own reasons for being able to make sure that that happens. And so, as far as we’re concerned, that means we’re full steam ahead on that part of the partnership. And things change over time, we’ll reevaluate. But for right now we want our customers to know -- our mutual customers to know, we’re actually full steam going to support you.
Brad Zelnick
Excellent. Just to pivot, slightly different question. KPIs metrics that you used to run the business, other than what we can see externally, what are the key measures of success for the Azure business inside of Microsoft?

Jason Zander
Yes. And we’ve got a ton, but here’s what I would say. The number one thing I want to look at is our customers happy with the platform and are they experiencing that? Now, one of the first things we would then measure from a business perspective is consumed revenue because if you think about from cloud services, we’re more interested when people are actually using it; the meters are spinning because we’re solving problems. So, we will absolutely look at the consumed revenue. And that is the stat that we published. You saw 76% growth in Q1 on Azure revenue growth that comes through. And that’s an example again. That's recognized because people are using it, not any kind of commit. So, that’s number one, and I also measure that one internally.
Now, if you look at the internal side of what we do, we will also look at a combination of am I making customers happy on the platform? So, I’ve got existing customers, is their usage started to increase, which would mean and be a sign of a healthy customer relationship where they're moving more workloads, they’re finding more value on the platform, we want to make sure that goes up. We’re also going to track from a business perspective the mix of services that the people use. So, as they get more and more into their cloud journey, if they’re able to then take advantage of some of the services we have, database as a service, platform as a service, then how is that usage increasing, because that’s also a good sign -- that healthy thing. Now for me internally owning products as well, there is a few other ones that are super interesting. I measure satisfaction. I’m very, very customer obsessed, I want to make sure that they’re happy. We look at net promoter scores and make sure that our customers like, would you recommend us to your friends? Yes. It’s the same thing on the commercial -- on the kind of client side. But we do the same thing for commercial here. I want to make sure those things are going quite well as well.
And of course the other metric that we would look at is net customer additions. So, if I got healthy customers and they’re growing and their mix is healthy, are we actually adding new customers as well. Those are sort of things that we track internally, and I won’t even get into all the perk and stress, and a whole bunch of engineering stuff that’s like two inches off the deck. I do that once a month with the entire division. It's a lot of fun, we call it fundamentals. We always say we put the fun in fun day. Engineers love it, it’s great. But anyway from a business perspective for this audience, those top of the ones are the ones that I think are most relevant.
Brad Zelnick
And as we think about measuring customers’ success, satisfaction, and then we think about that in the context of what elements of the offering they’ve actually gone ahead and adopted. You’ve got premium services, data services, we’ve talked a little bit about IoT at the lower levels, you’ve got infrastructure. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about the adoption pattern and economics of customer that goes all the way up and graduates to nirvana, layer seven or however you think about the world, and economics of that customer, the stickiness of that relationship and how we should think about that and the various adoption curves?

Layers seven is your networking background filling up. Okay. I can see that software engineers recognize that one. Obviously, we’re going to meet customers exactly where they are. So, the infrastructure, if they just want to come in and just want to get some hardware, compute networking storage absolutely supports that. At as a service things, we've got data bases, services, PaaS, Azure IoT, media and then also AI and ML, so prebuilt services for facial recognition and speech and text and all those kind of stuff. What those things do is they actually take away a lot of the tax that you otherwise do as a business to get things going. So, you think the benefit that one gets, like take the data solutions, those are great. We do things like automatic backup and point in time recovery. Like we make sure all of those things just work. We keep you patched and up to date. Those are things that cost you today because you're probably spending a lot of your personnel time on actually making sure that goes. If the service just does that for you, now I get that benefit. So, you get less kind of toil that comes through, and now I can actually get that. There is a very good value there.

What we find is as customers move up into those higher level services, then they can actually save money from an all up perspective, and that’s good. From a business, if you’re evaluating our business, of course these services are structurally higher margin and they are also sticker. And so, what that means is we hope that it's a win-win. Our customers get a better solution, it actually saves them money on the way in which they operate their overall state and they can actually take that savings and apply to new things; from our business perspective, since you are looking at Microsoft, again structurally higher margins, kind of a stickier environment, happier customers again, MSAT et cetera, then all these things kind of come together.
Now, a couple of great examples on this one. SQL Managed Instance, awesome an example. I can take SQL Server, including 2019, as the latest version of bunch of big data tech, just built in, I can run them on premises. The SQL Managed Instance allows me to take those same apps and move those up into the public cloud. And when I land those things there, we will take care of all that toil, those back-ups and patching, and all that kind of stuff that happens. Great example of that also again this end of life service support, fantastic impetus for people to make them that move, but also think the Cosmos DB. This is a worldwide, no SQL database, first of its kind out there. And today it’s actually a lot of work for engineers to go set up. They want to run something in three continents. You’ve got to do a lot of work to make sure that data can get replicated around the world and fast to keep the customers up and running. Cosmos DB, I just go in the portal, create a Cosmos DB, start writing data. We do all of it for you. Very unique, very differentiated, first to market with that kind of solution, great example. On the analytics side, SQL DW G2, cheaper and faster than Redshift, great solutions there as well, all wrapped into the AI stack. So that’s how we kind think about the structure when it comes through and there’s a lot of really, really nice product offerings.
Brad Zelnick
Related question, if we think about as measured by win rates or insights that you have on data on your customers, your success in Microsoft, historical Microsoft centric customers running a ton of SQL Server in the data center versus Oracle or whatever alternative might be, versus non-Microsoft centric versus Greenfield type cloud prospects, any commentary in terms of success and mix? It would seem naturally Microsoft centric accounts are easier to kind of welcome in the door, but any commentary along those lines?
Jason Zander
Thank you. It’s a good thing to point out. We do support all of the platforms and all those other vendors that you mentioned before, even when I have something that I compete with in that category, like relational databases. And I have customers, to be clear, they don’t used to look at Microsoft software, except Azure. They are 100% Linux; they are 100% Java; they are using MySQL or PostgreSQL, they are really using Oracle. So, 100% non-Microsoft stack, the only thing they’re using is our cloud for that. And like I mentioned our run rate on Linux virtual machines is actually higher now than Windows Server machines that are coming through. And so, we actually support all of that, very healthy mix. I am very excited about that, because they’re always -- you wouldn’t want people to think of us as just the Microsoft stack cloud. That’s not actually what we’re. We support everything. And I think our healthy run rate mix has proved that. And then, on top of that, as we point out, the fact that we did actually create all the other software, and there’s a lot of companies out there, we have high percentage of companies running Microsoft Server, running SQL server as well, that’s makes us the natural home. So, having an awesome third party support, open source support and then also being a natural home for Microsoft workloads I think this is a great found.

Brad Zelnick
And then on from a vertical perspective as well, I imagine there’s some obvious synergies and areas of opportunity, retail for example being one of that?
Jason Zander
Absolutely, retail is a really good one actually. As I mentioned before, I think a lot of the customers that we have, they don’t want to go spend money and get technology from a provider that turns around and uses that money to compete with them. So, you’re actually seeing a lot of companies -- and the more verticals that you start seeing covered by some of these other -- some my competition, the more they become the competition of people they’re otherwise serving. So, I see more and more inquires come in. So, verticals are actually there. We just finished up Black Friday and Cyber Monday. We had really, really major companies we work with, ASOS in the UK, Walmart, jet.com, it’s the whole set of big retailers that had a fantastic kind of holiday shopping season they went through, another great example, but there’s a lot more in fin structure, and manufacturing and energy and take a pick.
Brad Zelnick
In terms of the supply chain, as we think about infrastructure sourcing, can you talk a little bit about how those decisions get made? When you design in a specific chipset or whatever that component might be, what’s the philosophy behind choosing A versus B?
Jason Zander
Great question. And there’s kind of two angles I think about this. The first one is, just supply chain 101, capacity management 101. I mean, anybody done your MBA, done that kind of work, we have to make sure we’re absolutely great at that. And we’ve had massive, massive scale, really, really fast, we keep building the systems up. And this is a big scale business. This is not something where I can just get off the shelf components and just go run it. So, we’re also building those systems and the nice advantage on the hyperscale cloud, I can build the software for capacity and the supply chain work that we do and I can actually have that work very well with the control fabric that runs the fleet, which means I can get signals immediately and it all just kind of comes together in an integrated way.
From a vendor perspective, normal kind of hygiene, we pick from multiple vendors, we make sure we’re doing a good job from a sourcing perspective. We’ve also done open source projects here. We have this project called the SONiC, which is basically -- it’s a networking thing we contributed back. We’ve run that on top of switches. I don’t have to pay high premiums for switching inside of the data center because we did SONiC. We open sourced it; we made it available. I can run it on equipment. So, there’s example on the software side, where we can reduce costs, and I am not going to pay high margin. And in fact we could never do that with your data center, it would be cost prohibitive. But when you’re running at my scale, you do. From a hardware perspective, then we also partner with a lot of the hardware manufacturers. We buy there enough scale. You’d buy 1 million or something, not only do you get discount but you can also probably influence the design and we actually do that. And we also do some of our own custom hardware as well. We do things like we’ve deployed FPGAs across the fleet for networking. And we actually -- I have a whole silicon design team, and that's literally all they do. They design hardware, they design silicon, happens to be the same group but also does things like HoloLens and they do the Surface, and they actually do that for the rest of it. Same team also works in our data centers to figure out okay, what is the silicon improvements we should put in the data centers as well, so we have all of those.
Brad Zelnick
Talk a bit more about the advantages of using FPGAs and going that deep into the design?

Jason Zander
Yes. FPGA is really, really cool. I mean, a field programmable gate array. What that really means is, I have had burned in silicon, fastest kind of performance, software at the top, probably little bit the slower. FPGAs are right down here; they kind of come in just on the top of that. Key thing is, it gives me flexibility, I can actually go out and do additional tweaks, but I get hardware level speeds, not as fast as burnt in silicon but the next notch up. We can leverage this for networking, we get 100 gigabit connectivity for all of our virtual machines and we can continue to improve that. We can also leverage the things like AI. So for example our Brainwave project leverages FPGAs and does a really awesome job of things like image recognition, fantastic, so we can make those go. And then, of course from a silicon design perspective, the more those algorithms that we run in FPGAs as they get hardened, then we turn around to the silicon team and we turn that into custom silicon, custom ASICs. We’ll actually load that up into fleet and then we actually make more real estate available on our chips to do the next set of algorithms and next set of wins.
Brad Zelnick
Awesome. And by the way, I recently read about some of your efforts looking at building subsea data centers. And it wasn’t intuitive to me. I would just assume that it's a lot less expensive to build the data center on top of solid ground terra firma. What are the advantages you see there? And is this a science project, are we going to wake up one day and everybody is going to have data centers with SpongeBob underneath the sea? 
Jason Zander
In your pool or your backyard with cold drink. Yes. So, this particular project, this is a Project Natick is the code name for it. And this is a research project to be clear. And so our Microsoft research folks are pulling this back together. And what they’ve really done is they’ve taken the actual data center and put it under water, like literally, like in the off the coastal Scotland is the most recent one that guy dropped in. A couple of different things that that does. One, 50% of the world population actually lives near water. I mean, this is actually near a coastal line of some sort, which means that access to cities, you can put the data and compute capacity very, very, very close. You also of course have natural inflation and you have potentially perpetual energy off of waves and everything like that. This also gives us some experience on the lights-out perspective. So, for example, just to be clear, we don't actually go green light Johnny Quest in scuba gear to go down and fix the hard drive; we don’t do that. So, there is a lights out kind of opportunity where you have to figure out how can I run that hardware with a minimal amount of any touch. In fact once it’s down, no one touches it, till it’s done and decommissioned. And I think if you think about that in our essentially production, which are on terra firma and near-cheap energy and stable ground and everything else. So, those are the massive two square-mile sites that we build out. Then even that experience that we gain from this helps us do a better job operationalizing the fleet and doing a really great thing. And as we start doing more and more innovation, we’re starting to find that that even dovetails with stuff we do around quantum computing and other things as well. That knowledge we gain is actually quite interesting. 
Brad Zelnick
Jason, my only disappointed is that we don’t have more time because I got billion other questions to ask you. But with that, thank you immensely. This was tremendously insightful. I really appreciate your time at the CS Technology Conference. Thank you.
Jason Zander
Thank you so much for having. I appreciate it.
