'''there is a limit in azure notebooks with NLTK in that it does not save the downloaded NLTK libs we need to cache locally
this means we need to uncomment the very next statement and the sequence of commands will be
d   - that tell the downloader you want to download something
when it prompts again enter punkt - the tokenizer 
then it will prompt again for another action
enter d to run another download
enter stopwords and then return
finally, at the last step, enter q and hit return to exit. you can now run as long as your notebook session is alive to
please add the comment, or enter a q if the prompt appears on a subsequent run'''
